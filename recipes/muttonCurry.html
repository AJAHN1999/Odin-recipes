    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>
        Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho, lamb curry,or goat curry) is a dish that is prepared from goat
        meat(or sometimes lamb meat) and vegetables.
        Mutton curry was originally prepared putting all the ingredients together in a earthen pot and slow cooking the
        whole curry by wood fire on a clay oven.Today it is cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers after briefly
        saut√©ing all the ingredients and spices in a big wok.
        The steadily cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton.
        Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta.</p>

        <li>3/4 clove</li>
        <li>1/2 green cardamom</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Marination:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon yoghurt (curd)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Turmeric as required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1 Wash the mutton and marinate</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
            Wash the mutton pieces (chopped into cubes) in running water.
            Keep aside to drain. When the water has almost dried, add the marinade ingredients.
            Mix well using your hands, rubbing the spices into the meat. Marinate for 1-2 hours.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2 Cook the masala</li>
        <p>
            Now take a heavy-bottomed pan and heat. One with a tight lid is preferred.
            Add oil and ghee. When smoke starts coming out of it, add the whole spices.
            Add a pinch of sugar. It gives an amazing colour to the mutton.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3 Saute the onions</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
            Add the chopped onions and cook on low flame for 10 minutes. At this point, you can add the salt.
            This increases the cooking process of onion. When the onions turn translucent, reduce the heat and wait for
            them to turn pink.
            Add turmeric and mix well. You can add turmeric at a later stage also, but adding it in the beginning of the
            recipe helps you get rid of that raw smell of the spice</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4 Add the marinated meat and cook</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
            Now add the marinated mutton, ginger garlic paste and cook on high flame for 5-7 minutes, stirring
            continuously. It is advisable to use homemade ginger-garlic paste as the store bought one has high
            preservatives and it impacts the taste of mutton. At this point you can pressure cook the mutton. After 3
            whistles you must open the lid to check if the mutton is done.
            If not, cook for 1-2 more whistles. Do not add water while pressure cooking. Alternately, you can slow cook
            as suggested below.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 5 Cover the lid and cook on low flame</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
            Cover the lid of the vessel, lower the flame and allow it to simmer.
            When the mutton is almost done, add coriander, cumin, black pepper and mix well.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 6 Garnish and serve hot!</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
            Cook uncovered till oil starts separating from the meat. Add a cup of water, garam masala powder and cook
            uncovered till oil floats on top.
            Transfer the mutton curry into a bowl, adjust seasoning, garnish with ginger juliennes, coriander leaves and
            serve hot with steamed rice or chapatti</p>
    </ol>
