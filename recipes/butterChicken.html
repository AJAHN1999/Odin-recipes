<h2>Brief History:</h2>
<p>
    No one knows for sure how butter chicken came to be, but it's thought that it was first developed in North India.
    Its creation could have happened organically, with the traditional Indian dish of chicken curry becoming more
    buttery over time.
    The name butter chicken itself can be traced back to a specific restaurant whose owner used to refer to his
    signature dish as butter chicken as a secret code so he could communicate with his suppliers—who were banned from
    communicating directly with him by British law time.

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into roughly 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>1/4 cup full-fat plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander seed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri Lal Mirch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the sauce:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8 to 10 whole almonds</li>
    <li>8 to 10 whole cashews</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ground coriander seed</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground garam masala</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground Kashmiri Lal Mirch</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoon Kasuri Meth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3> Marinate the chicken: </h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage
        the marinade into the chicken.

        Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</p>
    <li>
        <h3> Soak cashews and almonds:</h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the
        recipe</p>
    <li>
        <h3> Cook the chicken:</h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.

        Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side,
        until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.</p>
    <li>
        <h3> Start making the sauce: </h3>
    </li>
    <p>

        Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as
        the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.

        Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off.
        The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.

        Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn
        off the heat.
    </p>
    <li>
        <h3> Purée the sauce with the nuts:</h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked, drained cashews and almonds.
        Blend into a smooth paste. </p>
    <li>
        <h3> Finish the dish:</h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth
        sauce.

        As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5
        minutes. </p>
    <li>
        <h3> Rest the butter chicken:</h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover
        again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter
        chicken. </p>
    <li>
        <h3> Serve:</h3>
    </li>
    <p>
        Serve the butter chicken with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated,
        covered, for up to 5 days.

        You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a
        saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.</p>
